A Web developper is someone who can skillfully code and design. We're not talking Art design here. I meant designing application architecture and components, API, process workflow, persistence layer, development and deployment flow including migration, test plans...</p><p>It's all about patterns anyway.</p><p>A developper invents stuff. He should push the limits of what's achievable and engineer solutions. Consider it like an ever-changing Rubik's cube. He is always up to date on his technical knowledge, and seeks to know more. Reading blogs, books, attending user groups and conferences really help.</p><p>- <em>"So, he's a social type of guy?"</em>, you'll ask.</p><p>No, because most of his time is spent coding behind a computer screen.</p><p>Yes, let's make it clear.</p><p>Coding is not about writing HTML and browsing for jQuery plugins on internet. It's about building applications to solve a specific problem, or answer a particular need. It's about creating neat little pieces of code that do amazing stuff, and giving it to the Community. Which will in return contribute by helping and improving.</p><p>That's how it works.</p><h1><small>I am a</small> UI designer</h1><p>A UI designer is an artist. He makes web sites look <span class="beautiful">Beautiful!</span></p><blockquote>The design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs. [...]<ul><li>The input/output dimension (the look)</li><li>The dialogue dimension (the feel)</li><li>The technical or functional dimension (the access to tools and services)</li><li>The organizational dimension (the communication and co-operation support)</li></ul><small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></small></blockquote><p>I couldn't summarize this in a better way.</p><p>The cool thing about UI design, is that it applies to a wide variety of IT projects such as websites, mobile apps, softwares, and even games.</p><p>Pragmatically, he is responsible to deliver the mock ups that will be validated by the customer and taken as reference by the developpers.</p><p>He works closely with the UX designer to deliver the best usage and browsing experience to the customer.</p><h1><small>I am a</small> UX designer</h1><p>How convenient.</p><p><em>"What's the difference with UI?"</em>, you say?</p><p>Whereas the UI designer makes a web page (look) appealing and (feel) organized, the UX designer makes it intuitive and comfortable. Consistency and predictability are the keys.</p><blockquote>User experience (UX) involves a person's behaviors, attitudes, and emotions about using a particular product, system or service. User experience includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human-computer interaction and product ownership. <small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></small></blockquote><p>A few years ago, UI/X design was considered as one profession: Web design. Today, with the growth in complexity of modern applications, designers tend to specialize in a sub-domain such as Interface or Experience design. I do both. And again, this is all about using and breaking patterns.</p><h1><small>I am a</small> Hacker</h1><p>But probably not the kind of hacker you're thinking of.</p><blockquote>Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help. [...]<br>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them. <small><a href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude">Eric Steven Raymond</a>, the Hacker Attitude</small></blockquote><p>Eric Steven has summarized the Hacker Attitude in these few mantras:</p><ol><li>The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.</li><li>No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</li><li>Boredom and drudgery are evil.</li><li>Freedom is good.</li><li>Attitude is no substitute for competence.</li></ol><p>Now that may seem a lot for one single person but that my friend, is <span class="uline">who I am</span>.</p></section></div></div></div><div class="row"><div id="employments" class="section page col-sm-12"><div class="section-logo"><span scroll-follow="employments" scroll-stop="#demos" class="logo logo-employments" title="Let's talk about my employments"><span class="scroll-text visible-lg visible-md">Employments</span></span></div><div class="section-logo-line"></div><h1 class="section-header">Employments</h1><div class="row"><section><h1>Silanis <small>- 2011 &#8230; today</small></h1><div class="row"><div class="col-md-2"><img class="company img-responsive" alt="e-SignLive, powered by Silanis" src="images/91447f9b.company-esignlive.png"></div><div class="col-md-10"><p>Design UI, UX, and web Application architecture and components in a Continuous Integration environment.</p><p>Lead the front end team and provide accurate plannings, consolidate the development effort over several of the company's products and services.

The amount of technical debt on this project makes it a very hard challenge, but I'll tell you my secret anyway: <em>slow migration</em>.</p><p>Although I have worked in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">Scrum</a> / <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile</a> team for a couple of years, our team has found a compromise with the "pull" aspect of the Kanban approach. Mixing what works best for us from each methodology, we came up with our own workflow.</p><p>I have been operating with <a href="www.trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> and <a href="www.atlassian.com/jira" target="_blank">Jira</a> for a while, but I recently came back to <a href="www.redmine.org" target="_blank">Redmine</a>.</p></section><section><h1>Quick Prototyping</h1><p>Also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development" target="_blank">Rapid Application Development</a>, Quick Prototyping is a technique I use for minor to medium feature design. It allows me to quickly hack the UI to instantly get a better idea of the look and feel of a feature once integrated. We can then play around live with the markup and css, and the prototype becomes the reference for future development.</p><p>However, it is does not play well when starting a project from scratch, as I find it too iterative.</p></section><section><h1>UI/X Design</h1><p>Because Quick Prototyping isn't enough for epic stories and monster features, and also because I'm a frustrated artist.</p><ul><li>Gimp</li><li>Photoshop</li><li>Illustrator</li><li>Sketchbook pro</li></ul><ul><li>NinjaMock</li><li>BalsamiQ</li></ul><p>It is worth mentioning that my favorite tool still is a pen and a big stack of stickies.</p><p></p></section><section><h1>X Driven Development and QA</h1><p>Where X could be one of either <b>Behavior</b>, <b>Design</b>, <b>Feature</b> or <b>Test</b>. As there is no "one for all" best practice, I recommend blending these techniques together, keeping in mind the following:</p><ul><li>BDD: how it should work</li><li>DDD: what it should look like when it works</li><li>FDD: what it should do</li><li>TDD: it should work</li></ul><p>Quality Assurance plays a different role in the development process, but it is far from being negligible. End-to-end testing and Integration testing comes after development is done, and often written by a separate team. Now with <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html" target="_blank">Karma</a> and <a href="https://github.com/angular/protractor" target="_blank">Protractor</a>, these tests can be written by the same people that made the features. This requires more discipline of course, but the end result is a huge gain in development time and a simpler project stack that still works very well with Continuous Integration tools like <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank">Jenkins</a> or <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis</a>.</p></section><section><h1>Optimization</h1><p>Optimization can be applied to a lot of different domains. Productivity, algorithms, UI/X, automation, load balancing, gaming, cooking, filling up the truck when moving...</p><p>It is also a synonym for <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/workflowsOfRefactoring/" target="_blank">Refactoring</a>, which is a known workflow to keep the code base clean and up to date.</p><p>Unlike my education classes where optimization was applied to complex algorithms, web development requires a different type of optimization. I learned it the hard way. Caching techniques, asset minification, local storage, web standards, sprites, css, feature detection, SEO, analytics, JSON and schemas, rest API's, session caching, database scripting, deployment, dependency management, page load vs versioning...</p><p>Welcome to the <a href="http://caniuse.com/" target="_blank">Web development</a> world!</p></section><section><h1>Mobile first</h1><p>Lately, my attention was brought to hand-held devices.</p><p>These devices have a great variety of screen sizes, hardware configuration, and constraints caused by firmwares and browsers. Because of that and their nature of touch-devices, they require more effort in term of UI and UX design.</p><p>On the other hand, customers require us to be compatible with <a href="http://www.modern.ie/ie6countdown" target="_blank">legacy browsers</a>, which only support a limited feature set of the most modern browsers. It quickly becomes a real headache to accomodate both sides of the coin.</p><p>To solve these problems, I use mobile-first frameworks like the famous <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, or <a href="http://ink.sapo.pt/" target="_blank">Ink</a>.</p></section><section><h1>Social</h1><p>Yes I am. I read a lot of books and articles about the matter and meet a lot of people at conferences, meetups, hackathons, gamejams...</p><p>It would be a full-time job to keep up to date about everything I know, but fortunately the <a href="https://geekli.st/DrDyne" target="_blank">geekli.st</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/3224086/drdyne" target="_blank">Stack Exchange</a> communities (among other) make it easier for me.
